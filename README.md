# jQuery Calculator

This purpose of this project was to create a calculator using jQuery, with both server-side and client-side logic.

## Features

Basic math operators: adding, subtracting, division, and multiplication.

Use of buttons for input

## Future updates

In the future, I would like to style the calculator with Bootstrap.

I would also like to clean up the code a little, and switch around some of the logic.
